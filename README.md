# ANN-without-DL-Libraries
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch in Python without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification, featuring core components like forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
